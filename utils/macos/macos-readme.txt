README for MOD Audio for macOS

For the moment the application bundle is not signed, and as such it will refuse to run by default.

To allow the application to run, please right-click on it and select open.
A warning will appear saying macOS cannot verify the application, that is expected.
Right-click and select to open it a 2nd time, and this time pick the new "Open" option to allow it to run.

Also, MOD App requires macOS 10.15 or later, it will not run on older versions.
