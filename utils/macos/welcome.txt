MOD Audio is on the desktop!

This is an installer for the MOD Desktop App for macOS.
After installation a "MOD Desktop App" will be available on your applications folder.

NOTE: At this point this tool should be considered in beta state.
Most things already work but we are still tweaking and fixing a lot.
Feedback and testing is very much appreciated, make sure to report issues you find during your own testing.
